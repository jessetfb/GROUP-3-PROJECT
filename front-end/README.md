## Description
The project aims to create a platform that enables users to rent vehicles anytime.
The user can perform the following functions: 
    - As a user, I can view detailed vehicle listings with photos, descriptions, and rental cost
    - As a user, I can experience secure authentication 
    - As a user, I can log in for an account, book cars, delete cars and log out from the account.
The team has plans to improve the app. The plans will be implemented at a later date.
